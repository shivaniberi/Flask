Flask Blog Project Summary
The Flask Blog Project guides you through creating a fully functional blog using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

Install Flask
Set up your development environment by installing Flask and its dependencies to create a foundation for the blog.

Creating a Base Application
Build the foundational Flask application by defining routes and testing functionality with a simple "Hello, World!" example.

Utilizing HTML Templates
Use Flask's templating engine, Jinja2, to create dynamic HTML pages. Organize templates for a consistent layout and styling across the blog.

Setting up the Database
Configure a database (e.g., SQLite) to store blog posts. Use SQLAlchemy or Flask-SQLAlchemy for database integration and management.

Displaying All Posts
Create a view that retrieves all posts from the database and displays them on the homepage in a user-friendly format.

Displaying a Single Post
Add functionality to display a detailed view of a single post by dynamically rendering its content based on the post ID.

Editing, Creating, and Deleting Posts
Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts. Add forms for creating and editing posts and functionality for deleting them from the database.

This project equips you with foundational Flask skills, database integration knowledge, and an understanding of building dynamic web applications with Python. For more inspiration, see the original guide on Medium.
